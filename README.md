# Uberfire Provisioning

A simple API to provision runtimes to different providers, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Servlet Containers (Wildfly, WAS, WebLogic, Tomcat, etc). This runtimes can be created based on different sources and by using a pipeline to build the binaries that needs to be provisioned. 

There are 5 building blocks
- **Source** (Allow us to get code locally from different sources, list all our sources, add new sources, etc)
- **Build** (API & Maven build provider implementation provided)
- **Runtime** (create new runtime in different providers: AppServers, Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift & control these runtimes)
- **Pipeline** (a way to control and chain the previous elements to we can move from source to runtime in just one service call)
- **Registry** (a way to keep track where our projects, runtimes and pipelines are)

On top of these building blocks you will find the Service Layer that allows you to interact with each step separately or with the pipelines to chain different steps together.


#Source / Workspace 
This module allows us to get code from external repositories so we can build it locally. The main idea behind these services are to provide us with a flexible way to manage our source repositories and enable us to get that code locally so it can be built. 

```
/**
 * The Source interface provides all the methods to obtain and manage the source code that 
 *  will be used by the other services. 
 */
public interface Source {
    /*
    * Retrieve the source code from a Repository 
    * returns the location (path) of the obtained code
    * Throws a SourcingException if:
    *   - the repository cannot  be located, 
    *   - the code cannot be retrieved
    *  @param repository a source code Repository to use as Source for our projects
    *  @return a String with the path to the retrieved source code
    *  @see Repository
    */
    public String getSource(Repository repository) throws SourcingException;
    
      /*
    * Clean the source code obtained from a repository 
    * @throws SourcingException if there is an issue trying to clean the repository local path
    * @param repository a repository to clean
    * @return true if the source was cleaned, false if it didn't exist
    * @see Repository
    */
    public boolean cleanSource(String sourcePath) throws SourcingException;
}
```

#Build
This block will be in charge of taking a project path and building the appropriate binaries for runtime. The generated binaries are can be located using this services.
```
/**
 *
 * The Build interface define a set of operations to generate
 * Binaries based on Projects
 * 
 */
public interface Build {

    /*
    *   Build the specified Project
    *   @param project a Project to build
    *   @throws BuildException if the build failed unexpectedly 
    *   @return the build output 0 if there wasn't an error
    *   @see Project
    */
    public int build(Project project) throws BuildException;

    /*
    * Check for the generated binaries for a given project
    * @param project a Project to check if the binaries are ready
    * @return true if the binaries are already generated
    * @see Project
    */
    public boolean binariesReady(Project project) throws BuildException;
    
    /* 
    * Returns the location of the binaries if exist
    * @param project the project for the binaries that we are looking for 
    * @return String with the location of the binaries
    * @see Project
    */
    public String binariesLocation(Project project) throws BuildException;
    
    /* 
    * Clean the generated binaries if exist
    * @param project the project for the binaries that we are looking to clean 
    * @return the clean output 0 if there wasn't an error
    * @see Project
    */
    public int cleanBinaries(Project project) throws BuildException;
    
    /*
    * Create a Docker Image for the given project
    * @return the output of the execution, if 0 the docker image was created
    * @see Project
    */
    public int createDockerImage(Project project) throws BuildException;
}
```


#Runtime
In order to provision runtimes there are 3 main concepts to understand:
 - **Provider Type** : it repesent a registered provider type into the system. This could be Docker, Kubernetes, Any Servlet container or Application Server 
 - **Provider** : it represent an actual instance of a provider. The provider repesent and contains the information to interact with a provider, so we can start provisioning things inside it. For docker, this relates to a specific Docker Deamon that we can contact, or an instance of an application server hosted remotely.
 - **Runtime** : a running container that we have provisioned and we can check the status or execute operations.

The project is divided into an SPI module whcih contains these concepts plus a set of providers that automatically register to the service via classpath resolution.

The current providers implementations are:
- Local / Fat Jar (new JVM) (uberfire-provisioning-fatjar-provider)
- Docker (uberfire-provisioning-docker-provider)
- Kubernetes (uberfire-provisioning-kubernetes-provider)
- Wildfly (uberfire-provisioning-wildfly-provider)

Once we have our new provisioned runtimes we can manage their state and control them remotely. 

By using the provided APIs we will end up creating runtimes, no matter the provider that we choose to use. 
These container instances should provide a way for the end users to execute operations and get information about state:
```
- public void start();
- public void stop();
- public void restart();
- public RuntimeInfo getInfo();
- public RuntimeState getState();
- public Provider getProvider();
- public RuntimeConfiguration getConfig();
```
# Pipeline
An API to define a set of Stages that can be chained to achieve different outputs. So for example you will be able to 
get sources from a remote repository and build those sources. Or get the generated binaries and create new runtimes into different providers. 

# Registry
The registry module provides a place to store (in a distributed way) the information related with Repositories, Projects, Providers, Runtimes, Pipelines and builds. The registry is separated into different registries for different concepts:
- Sources Registry 
- Build Registry
- Runtime Registry
- Pipelines Registry

The Registry project should provide a distributed implementation that allows multiple Service layers to access the same data.


# Services

A service layer is provided using JAX-RS services, so remote clients can register their provider instances and remotely provision new runtimes.

Multiple instances of the services can be started in different nodes and by using a distributed Registry module, they should be able to share the information about ProviderTypes, Providers and Runtimes.


Current Methods:
- **Source**
 - GET /api/sources  (Get all external sources repositories)
 - GET /api/sources/{id} (get repository location by id)
 - POST /api/sources  (register and clone external repository for local use)
 

- **Build**
 - GET /api/builds  (Get all builds)
 - POST /api/builds  (new build)

- **Runtime**
 - GET /api/providerstypes (Get All Provider Types)
 - GET /api/providers (Get All Providers)
 - GET /api/runtimes (Get All Runtimes)

 - POST /api/providers (New Provider)
 - POST /api/runtimes (New Runtime)
 - POST /api/runtimes/{id}/start (Start Runtime)
 - POST /api/runtimes/{id}/stop (Stop Runtime)
 - DELETE /api/runtimes/{id} (Remove Runtime)

- **Pipelines**
 - GET /api/pipelines (Get All Pipelines)
 - POST /api/pipelines (New Pipeline)
 - POST /api/pipelines/{id}/run (Run Pipeline)

# Getting Started
You can clone the repository and build all the projects using: mvn clean install (note that you need to have the M2_HOME variable set so maven-invoker can work)

In order to start the services you can do:
```
cd uberfire-provisioning-services-rest/target/
java -jar uberfire-provisioning-services-rest-swarm.jar
```

or alternatively with Docker (this will need to download the docker image first)
```
docker run -p 8080:8082 salaboy/uberfire-provisioning-services 
```
where 8082 is the port where the services are running and 8080 is the port that I will use to access from my environment.

You can also build and start your own docker image with:
```
cd uberfire-provisioning-services-rest/
mvn clean install docker:build docker:start
```

A Postman (Google Chrome add on) project is provided here, where you can execute operations against the services and sample requests are provided for most operations.

https://github.com/Salaboy/uberfire-provisioning/blob/master/uberfire-provisioning.json.postman_collection

You need to download/clone this file and then import it to Postman (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)

# Example From Sources to Provisioning

The following example show how to use the Uberfire Provision Services provision a new Runtime using as a starting point a Git repository. Different (Runtime) Providers can be configured, but for this example I will be showing Local, Wildfly and Docker. It is trivial to extend this example to provision to Openshift 3 Origin (Kubernetes).

First of all, we need to configure our Providers, this is were we want to provision new Runtimes. As mentioned before we will have 3 providers Local, Wildfly 10, and Docker. In order to do that we can register these 3 providers by executing the following requests to the Provision Services:

0) **Check the registered Provider Types** 
```
GET http://localhost:8082/api/providertypes
```
This should return:
```
[
  {
    "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.kubernetes.runtime.provider.KubernetesProvider",
    "version": "1",
    "providerTypeName": "kubernetes"
  },
  {
    "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.wildly10.Wildfly10Provider",
    "version": "10.0.0",
    "providerTypeName": "wildfly"
  },
  {
    "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProvider",
    "version": "1.0",
    "providerTypeName": "local"
  },
  {
    "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProvider",
    "version": "1.9.1",
    "providerTypeName": "docker"
  }
]
```

1) **Register Providers**
- **Local**: (this might be automatically registered in the future)
POST http://localhost:8082/api/providers/
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProviderConfiguration": {
        "name":"local fatjar runner"
    }
}
```
- **Wildfly 10**: (you need to have a Wildfly 10 running on localhost 9990 - mgmt port)
POST http://localhost:8082/api/providers/
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.base.WildflyProviderConfiguration": {
        "name":"wildfly at 9990", 
        "host": "localhost",
        "managementPort": "9990",
        "user": "salaboy",
        "password": "salaboy123$"
    }
}
```

- **Docker**: (this might be autoregistered based on the env variables in the future)
POST http://localhost:8082/api/providers/
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProviderConfiguration": {
        "name":"docker local"
    }
}
```

2) **Check all the registered providers**:
GET http://localhost:8082/api/providers/

```
[
  {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProvider": {
      "name": "local fatjar runner",
      "config": {
        "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProviderConfiguration": {
          "name": "local fatjar runner",
          "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProvider"
        }
      },
      "providerType": {
        "version": "1.0",
        "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalProvider",
        "providerTypeName": "local"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProvider": {
      "name": "docker local",
      "config": {
        "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProviderConfiguration": {
          "name": "docker local",
          "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProvider"
        }
      },
      "providerType": {
        "version": "1.9.1",
        "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.runtime.provider.DockerProvider",
        "providerTypeName": "docker"
      },
      "docker": {
        "host": "192.168.99.100"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.wildly10.Wildfly10Provider": {
      "name": "wildfly at 9990",
      "config": {
        "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.base.WildflyProviderConfiguration": {
          "name": "wildfly at 9990",
          "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.wildly10.Wildfly10Provider",
          "host": "localhost",
          "password": "salaboy123$",
          "user": "salaboy",
          "managementPort": "9990"
        }
      },
      "providerType": {
        "version": "10.0.0",
        "provider": "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.wildly10.Wildfly10Provider",
        "providerTypeName": "wildfly"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

3) **Source & Build**: 
Before being able to provision, we need to get the sources for our project and built it to generate their appropriate binaries. I will be using this repository: https://github.com/Salaboy/livespark-playground -> provisioning-enablement branch which contains a livespark app. 

- First all of all we need to register the repository:
POST http://localhost:8082/api/sources/
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.source.git.GitHubRepository":{
        "name":"livespark playground",
        "uri":"https://github.com/Salaboy/livespark-playground.git",
        "branch":"provisioning-enablement"
    }
}
```
Which returns the repository ID: for example: "db0e9df7-93f"

- Then you can check where the project was sourced (cloned)
GET http://localhost:8082/api/sources/db0e9df7-93f/location

Returns the temporary directory where the project sources are:
```
/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161
```

- Next you need to register the project itself (this might be done automatically later). Now we have the odd case of a repo that is not a project itself (there is no parent pom) so it needs to be manually registered:
POST http://localhost:8082/api/sources/db0e9df7-93f/
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.build.maven.model.MavenProject":{
        "name":"users-new",
        "rootPath":"/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161",
        "path": "users-new",
        "expectedBinary": "users-new.war"
    }
}
```


- Now that we have the project we can build it
POST http://localhost:8082/api/builds/
```
  {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.build.maven.model.MavenProject": {
      "id": "bc24c200-fb6",
      "name": "users-new",
      "type": "Maven",
      "rootPath": "/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161",
      "path": "users-new",
      "expectedBinary": "users-new.war"
    }
  }
```
This will trigger the maven build of the specified project leaving the binaries in the /target/ directory.

By doing a GET http://localhost:8082/api/builds/ we can get all the registered binaries:
```
[
  {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.build.maven.model.MavenBinary": {
      "location": "/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161/users-new/target/users-new.war",
      "type": "Maven",
      "name": "users-new.war",
      "sourceProject": {
        "org.uberfire.provisioning.build.maven.model.MavenProject": {
          "id": "bc24c200-fb6",
          "name": "users-new",
          "type": "Maven",
          "rootPath": "/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161",
          "path": "users-new",
          "expectedBinary": "users-new.war"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```


4) **Provisioning** : 
Now that we have our binaries we can provision new runtimes with them.

- **Wildfly** POST http://localhost:8082/api/runtimes/ (notice "wildfly at 9990" is our provider name)
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.wildfly.runtime.provider.base.WildflyRuntimeConfiguration":{
        "providerName":"wildfly at 9990",
        "warPath":"/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2026886451401276161/users-new/target/users-new.war"
        
    }
}
```
This should endup in having the application deployed in: http://localhost:8080/users-new/

- **Local**: POST http://localhost:8082/api/runtimes/ (notice "local fatjar runner" is our provider name)
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.local.runtime.provider.LocalRuntimeConfiguration":{
        "providerName":"local fatjar runner",
        "jar":"/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2299791269931823364/users-new/target/users-new-swarm.jar"
        
    }
}
```

This will return the runtime ID: for example: 4cae3713-86d
Now we need to start this runtime (as if we were starting a docker image or a webapp): 

POST http://localhost:8082/api/runtimes/4cae3713-86d/start

This will spawn a new JVM and start the jar file provided. The lifespark app will be available here: http://localhost:8080/ Notice that the fatjar created by the wildfly swarm plugin is located in the same location as the webapp + -swarm.jar. Look at here for deatils of the maven plugin configuration for this project to work: https://github.com/Salaboy/livespark-playground/blob/provisioning-enablement/users-new/pom.xml#L385

Notice that we might have some port clashing if we have a Wildfly and Swarm trying to use the 8080 port. For this reason using Docker is recommended :)

- **Docker**: 
Before creating a new docker runtime we need to create the docker image based on the Maven Project that we built before. For doing that we do: 
POST http://localhost:8082/api/builds/docker
```
 {
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.build.maven.model.MavenProject": {
      "id": "91aec094-c5e",
      "name": "users-new",
      "type": "Maven",
      "rootPath": "/private/var/folders/zl/qhjypfyd5k7bbtpgf276w0ww0000gn/T/uf-source2299791269931823364",
      "path": "users-new",
      "expectedBinary": "users-new"
    }
  }
```
This will create a new docker image called: salaboy/users-new . Look at the example to see the docker maven plugin configuration: https://github.com/Salaboy/livespark-playground/blob/provisioning-enablement/users-new/pom.xml#L397


POST http://localhost:8082/api/runtimes/ (notice "docker local" is our provider name)
```
{
    "org.uberfire.provisioning.docker.config.DockerRuntimeConfiguration":{
        "providerName":"docker local",
        "image":"salaboy/users-new"
        
    }
}
```
This will create a new docker image instance. With an ID: 4a3f42a1b6c8
You can start the instance by doing
POST http://localhost:8082/api/runtimes/4a3f42a1b6c8/start

The app should be now available here: http://192.168.99.100:32768/
